# Terminal-Media-Database

Terminal base sql data base, Created as a way for me to store some of what i collect physical media wise
Nothing to difficult to use- and has a way to view whatever one of the 3 databases you wish to use (being cds, movies, and books) 

Will mostlikely add more features as Time goes on to hopefully support html and what not
